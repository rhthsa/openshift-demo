## Prerequisites
- OpenShift 4.6 or 4.7
- Cluster-admin user access
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
- Cloud Provider Credentials

## Introduction

Original article from [Hibernate for cost savings for Advanced Cluster Management Provisioned Clusters with Subscriptions](https://www.openshift.com/blog/hibernate-for-cost-savings-for-advanced-cluster-management-provisioned-clusters-with-subscriptions)

OpenShift 4 has the ability to suspend and resume clusters on Cloud Providers. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management extends this capability through its Cluster Lifecycle Management (Hive), where you can have a policy to hibernate the clusters to save the cost saving in non-working hours (ex. 16 hours in a day is 16/24 = 66% saving)

## How ACM acheive Hibernate policies for OpenShift

We will walkthrough high-level process how ACM can define the herbernate policy for the cluster on Clouds

1. Clone the cluster-hibernate repository to your environment
2. Create the Running/Hibernate manifest files and put them in your Channel
3. Create the Subscription to local hub cluster with your desire time windows
